<p>There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he
was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So
one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his
mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling
the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the
flock was gone.</p>

<p>He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping
over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them
making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought
of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field,
bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees,
there was the Wolf!</p>

<p>The Kid knew there was little hope for him.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Wolf," he said trembling, "I know you are going to
eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and
be merry as long as I can."</p>

<p>The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he
struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still
evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs
pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings
before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the
pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the
Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to
please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.</p>

<p>The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter
how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter
punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he
would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.</p>

<p>After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that
wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the
Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by,
always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise
felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too,
and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs
that could hardly drag him along.</p>

<p>One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.</p>

<p>"We can help you to see the world," said the Ducks. "Take hold of
this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the
air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or
you will be sorry."</p>

<p>The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly
with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end,
and away they sailed up toward the clouds.</p>

<p>Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the
strange sight and cried:</p>

<p>"This must surely be the King of Tortoises!"</p>

<p>"Why certainly&mdash;&mdash;" began the Tortoise.</p>

<p>But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his
hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was
dashed to pieces on a rock.</p>

<p>A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much
to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the
farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to
the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of
spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.</p>

<p>At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his
custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very
nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the
Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and
both slept very comfortably.</p>

<p>With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he
forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard
where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak.
So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily.
But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far
off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very
delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was
roosting, he said very politely:</p>

<p>"A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you
how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become
the closest of friends."</p>

<p>"I feel highly flattered, kind sir," replied the Cock slyly. "If
you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of
the tree, my porter will let you in."</p>

<p>The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was
told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.</p>

<p>The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free
themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find
some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time
to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in
such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from
their dens by night or day.</p>

<p>Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good
enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:</p>

<p>"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be
successful. All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's
neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that
our enemy is coming."</p>

<p>All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of
such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their
good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:</p>

<p>"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But
let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?"</p>

<p>An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her
talons and made off with it to her nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed,
and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and
strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling
of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of
a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he
could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And
so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly
noticed he was there.</p>

<p>The Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what
had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its
wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children.</p>

call it, father?"</p>

<p>"That is a Jackdaw, my children. But if you should ask him, <i>he</i>

sank to the hub in a rut.</p>

<p>The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon

<p>A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country.
For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and
acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate
very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that,
and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple
food only to be polite.</p>

<p>After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town
Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse
listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow
and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the
Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries
and delights of city life that her friend had described for her.
So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go
home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.</p>

<p>When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they
found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine
banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious
cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can
imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a
dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at
the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place,
where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to
breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door
opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table,
followed by the House Dog.</p>

<p>The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long
enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.</p>

<p>"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not," she said as
she hurried away, "but I prefer my plain food and simple life in

walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only
to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p>

<p>A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not
far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very
dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or
play on his shepherd's pipe.</p>

<p>One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and
thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a
plan to amuse himself.</p>

<p>His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the
flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he
had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward
the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"</p>

<p>As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their
work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they
got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the
trick he had played on them.</p>

<p>A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!"
Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again.</p>

<p>Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the
shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did
spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.</p>

<p>In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!"
But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help
him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said.</p>

<p>The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped
away into the forest.</p>

<p>One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the meadow where his
Sheep were pastured. He very quickly captured the porker, which
squealed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his
hands on it. You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing,
that the Pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of its squeals
and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his
arm and started off to the butcher's in the market place.</p>

<p>The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the
Pig's behavior, and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the
pasture gate.</p>

<p>"What makes you squeal like that?" asked one of the Sheep. "The
Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should
feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like
you do."</p>

<p>The Frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so much
freedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sit
around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government
that could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty,
and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled.
No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they
sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king.</p>

<p>Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to
keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down
a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The
Frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the
new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how
tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger
Frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogs
made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter
about the government.</p>

<p>To teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a
Crane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a very
different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor
Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been.
In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel
tyrant before they should all be destroyed.</p>

<p>"How now!" cried Jupiter "Are you not yet content? You have what
you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your
misfortunes."</p>

</div>

<p>The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after
sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows
rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking
from the old hollow tree. Now her weird "hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo"
echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the
bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.</p>

<p>Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and
hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything
disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she
dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby
began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head
from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and
for window.</p>

<p>"Get away from here, sir," she said to the Grasshopper. "Have you
no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to
sleep in quiet!"</p>

<p>But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to
his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak.
Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span></p>

<p>The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to
argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that
matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit
her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside
all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.</p>

<p>"Well sir," she said, "if I must stay awake, I am going to settle
right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have
a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told
Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up
and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you
sing like Apollo himself."</p>

<p>The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering
words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near
enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him
and ate him up.</p>

<p>A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds.
When the wind blew, the great Oak stood proudly upright with its

<p>"You have reason to complain," said the Oak. "The slightest
breeze that ruffles the surface of the water makes you bow your
heads, while I, the mighty Oak, stand upright and firm before the
howling tempest."</p>

harm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in all
your pride and strength, have so far resisted their blows. But
the end is coming."</p>

<p>As the Reeds spoke a great hurricane rushed out of the north. The

<p>A certain man who visited foreign lands could talk of little when
he returned to his home except the wonderful adventures he had
met with and the great deeds he had done abroad.</p>

<p>One of the feats he told about was a leap he had made in a city
Called Rhodes. That leap was so great, he said, that no other man
could leap anywhere near the distance. A great many persons in
Rhodes had seen him do it and would prove that what he told was
true.</p>

<p>"No need of witnesses," said one of the hearers. "Suppose this
city is Rhodes. Now show us how far you can jump."</p>

precious jewel that had been lost by its owner.</p>

<p>At a great celebration in honor of King Lion, the Monkey was
asked to dance for the company. His dancing was very clever
indeed, and the animals were all highly pleased with his grace
and lightness.</p>

<p>The praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel
envious. He was very sure that he could dance quite as well as
the Monkey, if not better, so he pushed his way into the crowd
that was gathered around the Monkey, and rising on his hind legs,
began to dance. But the big hulking Camel made himself very
ridiculous as he kicked out his knotty legs and twisted his long
clumsy neck. Besides, the animals found it hard to keep their
toes from under his heavy hoofs.</p>

<p>At last, when one of his huge feet came within an inch of King
Lion's nose, the animals were so disgusted that they set upon the
Camel in a rage and drove him out into the desert.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, refreshments, consisting mostly of Camel's
hump and ribs, were served to the company.</p>

<p>An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantly
in each other's company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit of
greens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring
farmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day the
pair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened,
but the Fox calmed his fears.</p>

<p>"I will talk to him," he said.</p>

<p>So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion.</p>

<p>"Your highness," he said in an undertone, so the Ass could not
hear him, "I've got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise not
to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit
where he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure."</p>

<p>The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass.</p>

<p>"I made him promise not to hurt us," said the Fox. "But come, I

<p>So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion saw
that the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck down

<p>The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No
compromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw.
It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of
Geese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. The Beasts, too,
had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on the
Hare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice.</p>

<p>It was a terrible battle. Many a Hare and many a Mouse died.
Chickens and Geese fell by the score&mdash;and the victor always
stopped for a feast.</p>

<p>Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side. They were a
very politic race. So when they saw the Birds getting the better
of it, they were Birds for all there was in it. But when the tide
of battle turned, they immediately sided with the Beasts.</p>

<p>When the battle was over, the conduct of the Bats was discussed
at the peace conference. Such deceit was unpardonable, and Birds
and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats. And since
then the Bat family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins,
flying out only in the night.</p>

<p>A stray Lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a
woodland stream. That very same morning a hungry Wolf came by
farther up the stream, hunting for something to eat. He soon got
his eyes on the Lamb. As a rule Mr. Wolf snapped up such
delicious morsels without making any bones about it, but this
Lamb looked so very helpless and innocent that the Wolf felt he
ought to have some kind of an excuse for taking its life.</p>

<p>"How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the
mud!" he shouted fiercely. "You deserve to be punished severely
for your rashness!"</p>

<p>"But, your highness," replied the trembling Lamb, "do not be
angry! I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up
there. Remember, you are upstream and I am downstream."</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> muddy it!" retorted the Wolf savagely. "And besides, I

<p>"How could I have done so?" pleaded the Lamb. "I wasn't born

her off to the forest.</p>

<p>"You must come and dine with me today," he said to the Stork,
smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play. The Stork
gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with
a very good appetite.</p>

<p>For dinner the Fox served soup. But it was set out in a very
shallow dish, and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip

it up easily, and, to increase the disappointment of the Stork,
made a great show of enjoyment.</p>

calm, even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage.
Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him
in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set,
and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing
smell. But it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span> served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck.
The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but
all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and
sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper,

azure, he strutted proudly among the birds. All regarded him with
envy. Even the most beautiful pheasant could see that his beauty
was surpassed.</p>

<p>Presently the Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue
sky and felt a desire to fly, as he had been accustomed to do.
Lifting his wings he tried to rise from the ground. But the
weight of his magnificent train held him down. Instead of flying
up to greet the first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the

the scraps from the table. <i>Then</i> is the time to eat me."</p>

fine fat Dog to eat instead of the scrawny object before him. So
he went away pulling in his belt and promising to return.</p>

<p>Some days later the Wolf came back for the promised feast. He
found the Dog in his master's yard, and asked him to come out and
be eaten.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the Dog, with a grin, "I shall be delighted to have
you eat me. I'll be out as soon as the porter opens the door."</p>

experience to be very unkind toward wolves. So he decided not to
wait and made off as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

refined in manner. Yet he imagined that all he needed to make
himself fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like
theirs. So he picked up some castoff feathers of the Peacocks and
stuck them among his own black plumes.</p>

<p>Dressed in his borrowed finery he strutted loftily among the
birds of his own kind. Then he flew down into the garden among
the Peacocks. But they soon saw who he was. Angry at the cheat,
they flew at him, plucking away the borrowed feathers and also
some of his own.</p>

<p>The poor Jackdaw returned sadly to his former companions. There
another unpleasant surprise awaited him. They had not forgotten
his superior airs toward them, and, to punish him, they drove him
away with a rain of pecks and jeers.</p>

<p>It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for
Athens was wrecked off the coast close to Piraeus, the port of
Athens. Had it not been for the Dolphins, who at that time were
very friendly toward mankind and especially toward Athenians, all
would have perished. But the Dolphins took the shipwrecked people
on their backs and swam with them to shore.</p>

<p>Now it was the custom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys
and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage. So when one of
the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water, he thought it
was a man, and made the Monkey climb up on his back. Then off he
swam with him toward the shore.</p>

<p>The Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the Dolphin's back.</p>

<p>"You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?" asked the
Dolphin politely.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Monkey, proudly. "My family is one of the
noblest in the city."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the Dolphin. "Then of course you often visit
Piraeus."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied the Monkey. "Indeed, I do. I am with him
constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend."</p>

<p>This answer took the Dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head,
he now saw what it was he was carrying. Without more ado, he
dived and left the foolish Monkey to take care of himself, while
he swam off in search of some human being to save.</p>

<p>An Ass was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolf
lurking in the shadows along the hedge. He easily guessed what
the Wolf had in mind, and thought of a plan to save himself. So
he pretended he was lame, and began to hobble painfully.</p>

<p>When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass what had made him lame,
and the Ass replied that he had stepped on a sharp thorn.</p>

<p>"Please pull it out," he pleaded, groaning as if in pain. "If you
do not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me."</p>

<p>The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice, for he wanted to enjoy his
meal without any danger of choking. So the Ass lifted up his foot
and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the
thorn.</p>

<p>Just then the Ass kicked out with all his might, tumbling the
Wolf a dozen paces away. And while the Wolf was getting very

<p>Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same
house. They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts
of mischief together. What they seemed to think of more than
anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter
much to them how they got it.</p>

<p>One day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts
roasting on the hearth. How to get them was the question.</p>

<p>"I would gladly get them," said the cunning Monkey, "but you are
much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull them out and
I'll divide them between us."</p>

<p>Pussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of
the cinders, and drew back her paw very quickly. Then she tried
it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A
third time and she drew out the chestnut. This performance she
went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely.
As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, the Monkey
ate them up.</p>

<p>Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress
Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. From that time on, they
say, she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to
do with Sir Monkey.</p>

though they drank and drank until, one after another, all of them
had burst with drinking, still, for all their effort, the water

his beady eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long

<p>"Have you heard the wonderful news?" cried the Fox in a very
joyful and excited manner.</p>

<p>"What news?" asked the Cock very <ins class="typo" title="Original reads calmy.">calmly</ins>. But he had a queer,

bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved his fine long
tail and smiled.</p>

<p>At first the Cranes flew away in great terror. But they soon
began to see that none of them ever got hurt. They did not even
hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for
words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span> they would kill nobody. At last they paid no attention
whatever to the Farmer.</p>

<p>The Farmer saw that he would have to take other measures. He
wanted to save at least some of his grain. So he loaded his sling
with stones and killed several of the Cranes. This had the effect
the Farmer wanted, for from that day the Cranes visited his field
no more.</p>

<p>A rich old farmer, who felt that he had not many more days to
live, called his sons to his bedside.</p>

<p>"My sons," he said, "heed what I have to say to you. Do not on
any account part with the estate that has belonged to our family
for so many generations. Somewhere on it is hidden a rich
treasure. I do not know the exact spot, but it is there, and you
will surely find it. Spare no energy and leave no spot unturned
in your search."</p>

set to work digging with all their might, turning up every foot
of ground with their spades, and going over the whole farm two or
three times.</p>

<p>No hidden gold did they find; but at harvest time when they had
settled their accounts and had pocketed a rich profit far greater
than that of any of their neighbors, they understood that the
treasure their father had told them about was the wealth of a
bountiful crop, and that in their industry had they found the
treasure.</p>

<p>Two Pots, one of brass and the other of clay, stood together on

hard I will step between and save you."</p>

<p>So the Earthen Pot at last consented, and the two set out side by

<p>The Earthen Pot could not survive that sort of companionship very

<p>There was once a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful

<p>The Countryman took the eggs to market and soon began to get

getting rich fast enough.</p>

killing the Goose and cutting it open. But when the deed was
done, not a single golden egg did he find, and his precious Goose
was dead.</p>

so sure as they had been early that morning. Thus it happened
that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool.</p>

<p>The Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with
which to make a living, and he had not money enough to buy a new
one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury
suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. The Woodman
told what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury dived
into the pool. When he came up again he held a wonderful golden
axe.</p>

<p>"Is this your axe?" Mercury asked the Woodman.</p>

<p>"No," answered the honest Woodman, "that is not my axe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span></p>

<p>Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the
pool. This time he brought up an axe of silver, but the Woodman
declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a
wooden handle.</p>

<p>Mercury dived down for the third time, and when he came up again
he had the very axe that had been lost.</p>

<p>The poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and
could not thank the kind god enough. Mercury was greatly pleased
with the Woodman's honesty.</p>

<p>"I admire your honesty," he said, "and as a reward you may have
all three axes, the gold and the silver as well as your own."</p>

<p>The happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures, and
soon the story of his good fortune was known to everybody in the
village. Now there were several Woodmen in the village who
believed that they could easily win the same good fortune. They
hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding their
axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost them. Then they wept
and wailed and called on Mercury to help them.</p>

<p>And indeed, Mercury did appear, first to this one, then to that.
To each one he showed an axe of gold, and each one eagerly
claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury did not give
them the golden axe. Oh no! Instead he gave them each a hard
whack over the head with it and sent them home. And when they
returned next day to look for their own axes, they were nowhere
to be found.</p>

tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish

<p>The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore;
but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse

water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it

<p>An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not
so easy for him to get food as in his younger days, pretended
that he was sick. He took care to let all his neighbors know
about it, and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors. And
when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by
one.</p>

<p>The Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at
a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the
Lion's health. The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and
asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely
stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to do as you ask," he added, "but I have
noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and
none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their
way out again?"</p>

<p>Now they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a

the jaws of the Nemean Lion.</p>

<p>There was once an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. This Dog
was a favorite and received many a pat and kind word from his
Master, as well as choice bits from his plate. Every day the Dog
would run to meet the Master, frisking playfully about and
leaping up to lick his hands and face.</p>

<p>All this the Ass saw with much discontent. Though he was well
fed, he had much work to do; besides, the Master hardly ever took
any notice of him.</p>

<p>Now the jealous Ass got it into his silly head that all he had to
do to win his Master's favor was to act like the Dog. So one day
he left his stable and clattered eagerly into the house.</p>

<p>Finding his Master seated at the dinner table, he kicked up his
heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily around the table,
upsetting it as he did so. Then he planted his forefeet on his
Master's knees and rolled out his tongue to lick the Master's
face, as he had seen the Dog do. But his weight upset the chair,
and Ass and man rolled over together in the pile of broken dishes
from the table.</p>

<p>The Master was much alarmed at the strange behavior of the Ass,
and calling for help, soon attracted the attention of the
servants. When they saw the danger the Master was in from the
clumsy beast, they set upon the Ass and drove him with kicks and
blows back to the stable. There they left him to mourn the
foolishness that had brought him nothing but a sound beating.</p>

<p>A Milkmaid had been out to milk the cows and was returning from
the field with the shining milk pail balanced nicely on her head.
As she walked along, her pretty head was busy with plans for the
days to come.</p>

<p>"This good, rich milk," she mused, "will give me plenty of cream
to churn. The butter I make I will take to market, and with the
money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching. How
nice it will be when they are all hatched and the yard is full of
fine young chicks. Then when May day comes I will sell them, and
with the money I'll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair.
All the young men will look at me. They will come and try to make
love to me,&mdash;but I shall very quickly send them about their
business!"</p>

<p>As she thought of how she would settle that matter, she tossed
her head scornfully, and down fell the pail of milk to the
ground. And all the milk flowed out, and with it vanished butter

<p>There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs
of the village were so wide awake and watchful. He was really
nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to
think of it.</p>

<p>One night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dog
who had wandered a little too far from home. The Wolf would
gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked
strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the Wolf
spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fine
appearance.</p>

<p>"You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to," replied the Dog.
"Leave the woods; there you live miserably. Why, you have to
fight hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will
get along beautifully."</p>

<p>"What must I do?" asked the Wolf.</p>

<p>"Hardly anything," answered the House Dog. "Chase people who
carry canes, bark at beggars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span> and fawn on the people of the
house. In return you will get tidbits of every kind, chicken
bones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside,
not to speak of kind words and caresses."</p>

<p>The Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that
he almost wept. But just then he noticed that the hair on the
Dog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed.</p>

<p>"What is that on your neck?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," replied the Dog.</p>

<p>"What! nothing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a trifle!"</p>

<p>"But please tell me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is
fastened."</p>

<p>"What! A chain!" cried the Wolf. "Don't you go wherever you
please?"</p>

<p>"Not always! But what's the difference?" replied the Dog.</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world! I don't care a rap for your
feasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young lambs in the
world at that price." And away ran the Wolf to the woods.</p>

<p>A Fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after
much painful tugging, in getting away. But he had to leave his
beautiful bushy tail behind him.</p>

<p>For a long time he kept away from the other Foxes, for he knew
well enough that they would all make fun of him and crack jokes
and laugh behind his back. But it was hard for him to live alone,
and at last he thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out
of his trouble.</p>

<p>He called a meeting of all the Foxes, saying that he had
something of great importance to tell the tribe.</p>

<p>When they were all gathered together, the Fox Without a Tail got
up and made a long speech about those Foxes who had come to harm
because of their tails.</p>

<p>This one had been caught by hounds when his tail had become
entangled in the hedge. That one had not been able to run fast
enough because of the weight of his brush. Besides, it was well
known, he said, that men hunt Foxes simply for their tails, which
they cut off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the danger
and uselessness of having a tail, said Master Fox, he would
advise every Fox to cut it off, if he valued life and safety.</p>

<p>When he had finished talking, an old Fox arose, and said,
smiling:</p>

<p>"Master Fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have
your answer."</p>

<p>When the poor Fox Without a Tail turned around, there arose such
a storm of jeers and hooting, that he saw how useless it was to
try any longer to persuade the Foxes to part with their tails.</p>

<p>"Well," retorted the Cat, "I admit I know one trick only, but
that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!"</p>

clearly; there he raised himself up on his hind legs, and began a
wild dance. First he whirled 'round and 'round like a top, then
he hopped up and down, cutting all sorts of strange capers. The
Pheasants stared giddily. They hardly dared blink for fear of
losing him out of their sight a single instant.</p>

<p>By this time the poor birds' heads were in a whirl. And when the
Fox began his performance all over again, so dazed did they
become, that they lost their hold on the limb, and fell down one

<p>A Porcupine was looking for a good home. At last he found a
little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes. He asked
them to let him share the cave with them, and the Snakes kindly
consented.</p>

<p>The Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay.
His sharp quills pricked them at every turn, and at last they
politely asked him to leave.</p>

<p>"I am very well satisfied, thank you," said the Porcupine. "I
intend to stay right here." And with that, he politely escorted
the Snakes out of doors. And to save their skins, the Snakes had
to look for another home.</p>

<p>At a great meeting of the Animals, who had gathered to elect a
new ruler, the Monkey was asked to dance. This he did so well,
with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the Animals were
carried entirely off their feet with enthusiasm, and then and
there, elected him their king.</p>

<p>The Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted with
the Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler.</p>

<p>One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying to
King Monkey, he told him he had found a rich treasure, which he
had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the
Monkey.</p>

<p>The greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap. As soon as he saw
the meat he grasped eagerly for it, only to find himself held
fast in the trap. The Fox stood off and laughed.</p>

<p>"You pretend to be our king," he said, "and cannot even take care
of yourself!"</p>

<p>Shortly after that, another election among the Animals was held.</p>

<p>Early one morning a hungry Wolf was prowling around a cottage at
the edge of a village, when he heard a child crying in the house.
Then he heard the Mother's voice say:</p>

<p>"Hush, child, hush! Stop your crying, or I will give you to the
Wolf!"</p>

<p>Surprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal,
the Wolf settled down under an open window, expecting every
moment to have the child handed out to him. But though the little
one continued to fret, the Wolf waited all day in vain. Then,
toward nightfall, he heard the Mother's voice again as she sat
down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep.</p>

<p>"There, child, there! The Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy
is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near!"</p>

<p>Just then the Father came within sight of the home, and the Wolf
was barely able to save himself from the Dogs by a clever bit of
running.</p>

gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to
foot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pull
their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving their
lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals. Many
died, and those who lived were so ill, that they cared for
neither food nor drink, and dragged themselves about listlessly.
No longer could a fat young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner, nor a
tender lamb rouse greedy Sir Wolf's appetite.</p>

<p>At last the Lion decided to call a council. When all the animals
were gathered together he arose and said:</p>

<p>"Dear friends, I believe the gods have sent this plague upon us
as a punishment for our sins. Therefore, the most guilty one of
us must be offered in sacrifice. Perhaps we may thus obtain
forgiveness and cure for all.</p>

<p>"I will confess all <i>my</i> sins first. I admit that I have been
very greedy and have devoured many sheep. They had done me no
harm. I have eaten goats and bulls and stags. To tell the truth,
I even ate up a shepherd now and then.</p>

<p>"Now, if I am the most guilty, I am ready to be sacrificed. But I
think it best that each one confess his sins as I have done. Then
we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty."</p>

<p>"Your majesty," said the Fox, "you are too good. Can it be a
crime to eat sheep, such stupid mutton heads? No, no, your
majesty. You have done them great honor by eating them up.</p>

<p>"And so far as shepherds are concerned, we all know they belong
to that puny race that pretends to be our masters."</p>

<p>All the animals applauded the Fox loudly. Then, though the Tiger,
the Bear, the Wolf, and all the savage beasts recited the most
wicked deeds, all were excused and made to appear very saint-like
and innocent.</p>

<p>It was now the Ass's turn to confess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember," he said guiltily, "that one day as I was passing a
field belonging to some priests, I was so tempted by the tender
grass and my hunger, that I could not resist nibbling a bit of
it. I had no right to do it, I admit&mdash;"</p>

<p>A great uproar among the beasts interrupted him. Here was the
culprit who had brought misfortune on all of them! What a
horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else!
It was enough to hang anyone for, much more an Ass.</p>

<p>Immediately they all fell upon him, the Wolf in the lead, and
soon had made an end to him, sacrificing him to the gods then and
there, and without the formality of an altar.</p>

suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region
among the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves. But
before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would
help him find the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, but
just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a
huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror the
Shepherd fell on his knees.</p>

<p>The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the

had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started
the runners off.</p>

<p>The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel
very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a
Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the
Tortoise should catch up.</p>

<p>A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Wasps
declared positively that it belonged to them. The Bees were just
as sure that the treasure was theirs. The argument grew very
pointed, and it looked as if the affair could not be settled
without a battle, when at last, with much good sense, they
<i>agreed</i> to let a judge decide the matter. So they brought the
case before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of the
woods.</p>

<p>When the Judge called the case, witnesses declared that they had
seen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollow
tree, who hummed loudly, and whose bodies were striped, yellow
and black, like Bees.</p>

<p>Counsel for the Wasps immediately insisted that this description
fitted his clients exactly.</p>

<p>Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision, so he
adjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think it over.
When the case came up again, both sides had a large number of
witnesses. An Ant was first to take the stand, and was about to
be cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court.</p>

<p>"Your honor," he said, "the case has now been pending for six
weeks. If it is not decided soon, the honey will not be fit for
anything. I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed
to build a honey comb. Then we shall soon see to whom the honey
really belongs."</p>

<p>The Wasps protested loudly. Wise Judge Hornet quickly understood
why they did so: They knew they could not build a honey comb and
fill it with honey.</p>

<p>"It is clear," said the Judge, "who made the comb and who could
not have made it. The honey belongs to the Bees."</p>

<p>A Lark made her nest in a field of young wheat. As the days
passed, the wheat stalks grew tall and the young birds, too, grew
in strength. Then one day, when the ripe golden grain waved in
the breeze, the Farmer and his son came into the field.</p>

<p>"This wheat is now ready for reaping," said the Farmer. "We must
call in our neighbors and friends to help us harvest it."</p>

<p>The young Larks in their nest close by were much frightened, for
they knew they would be in great danger if they did not leave the
nest before the reapers came. When the Mother Lark returned with
food for them, they told her what they had heard.</p>

<p>"Do not be frightened, children," said the Mother Lark. "If the
Farmer said he would call in his neighbors and friends to help
him do his work, this wheat will not be reaped for a while yet."</p>

<p>A few days later, the wheat was so ripe, that when the wind shook
the stalks, a hail of wheat grains came rustling down on the
young Larks' heads.</p>

<p>"If this wheat is not harvested at once," said the Farmer, "we
shall lose half the crop. We cannot wait any longer for help from
our friends. Tomorrow we must set to work, ourselves."</p>

<p>When the young Larks told their mother what they had heard that
day, she said:</p>

<p>"Then we must be off at once. When a man decides to do his own
work and not depend on any one else, then you may be sure there
will be no more delay."</p>

<p>There was much fluttering and trying out of wings that afternoon,
and at sunrise next day, when the Farmer and his son cut down the
grain, they found an empty nest.</p>

<p>There was once a Cat who was so watchful, that a Mouse hardly
dared show the tip of his whiskers for fear of being eaten alive.
That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with his claws all ready
for a pounce. At last the Mice kept so closely to their dens,
that the Cat saw he would have to use his wits well to catch one.
So one day he climbed up on a shelf and hung from it, head
downward, as if he were dead, holding himself up by clinging to
some ropes with one paw.</p>

<p>When the Mice peeped out and saw him in that position, they
thought he had been hung up there in punishment for some misdeed.
Very timidly at first they stuck out their heads and sniffed
about carefully. But as nothing stirred, all trooped joyfully out
to celebrate the death of the Cat.</p>

<p>Just then the Cat let go his hold, and before the Mice recovered
from their surprise, he had made an end of three or four.</p>

<p>Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever. But the Cat,
who was still hungry for Mice, knew more tricks than one. Rolling
himself in flour until he was covered completely, he lay down in
the flour bin, with one eye open for the Mice.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the Mice soon began to come out. To the Cat it was
almost as if he already had a plump young Mouse under his claws,
when an old Rat, who had had much experience with Cats and traps,
and had even lost a part of his tail to pay for it, sat up at a
safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived.</p>

<p>"Take care!" he cried. "That may be a heap of meal, but it looks
to me very much like the Cat. Whatever it is, it is wisest to
keep at a safe distance."</p>

<p>One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose
through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the
limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first Crow the
Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made
him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of
cheese in her beak.</p>

<p>"No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is
a dainty bite for my breakfast."</p>

<p>Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was
sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning,
beautiful creature!"</p>

<p>The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox
suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese
and did not return his greeting.</p>

<p>"What a charming creature she is!" said the Fox. "How her
feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings!
Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since
everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one
song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds."</p>

<p>Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her
suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be
called Queen of Birds.</p>

<p>So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down
fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. "Though
it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your
wits?"</p>

<p>The Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the Boy
to climb up behind him.</p>

<p>They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up
from another company of people on the road.</p>

<p>"What a crime," cried one, "to load up a poor dumb beast like
that! They look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to
carry them."</p>

<p>"They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide," said
another.</p>

<p>The Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time
later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came
along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of
people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight.</p>

<p>The Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up
to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and
bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes
that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river.</p>

<p>The poor Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please
everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass besides.</p>

<p>A Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. The Ant struggled in vain to
reach the bank, and in pity, the Dove dropped a blade of straw
close beside it. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor
to a broken spar, the Ant floated safely to shore.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with
a stone. But just as he cast the stone, the Ant stung him in the
heel, so that the pain made him miss his aim, and the startled
Dove flew to safety in a distant wood.</p>

<p>A long time ago a Man met a Satyr in the forest and succeeded in
making friends with him. The two soon became the best of
comrades, living together in the Man's hut. But one cold winter
evening, as they were walking homeward, the Satyr saw the Man
blow on his fingers.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" asked the Satyr.</p>

<p>"To warm my hands," the Man replied.</p>

<p>When they reached home the Man prepared two bowls of porridge.
These he placed steaming hot on the table, and the comrades sat
down very cheerfully to enjoy the meal. But much to the Satyr's
surprise, the Man began to blow into his bowl of porridge.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To cool my porridge," replied the Man.</p>

<p>The Satyr sprang hurriedly to his feet and made for the door.</p>

cold in the same breath cannot be friends with me!"</p>

<p>Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for
her household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.</p>

<p>"Take good care of the house, my son," she said to the Kid, as
she carefully latched the door. "Do not let anyone in, unless he
gives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all his race!'"</p>

<p>Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat
had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he
trotted to the door and knocked.</p>

<p>"Down with the Wolf and all his race," said the Wolf softly.</p>

<p>It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a
crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did not
feel at all easy.</p>

<p>"Show me a white paw," he said, "or I won't let you in."</p>

<p>A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so
Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.</p>

<p>"You can never be too sure," said the Kid, when he saw the Wolf
making off to the woods.</p>

<p>A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a
large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil.
This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share.</p>

<p>The Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage
over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to
the pile of slain.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the Fox.</p>

<p>"You divide it," he roared angrily.</p>

<p>The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game
into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for
himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a
mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail.</p>

<p>The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely.</p>

<p>"Who taught you to divide so fairly?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>A long time ago, the Lion, the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf
agreed to go hunting together, sharing with each other whatever
they found.</p>

<p>One day the Wolf ran down a Stag and immediately called his
comrades to divide the spoil.</p>

<p>Without being asked, the Lion placed himself at the head of the
feast to do the carving, and, with a great show of fairness,
began to count the guests.</p>

<p>"One," he said, counting on his claws, "that is myself the Lion.
Two, that's the Wolf, three, is the Jackal, and the Fox makes
four."</p>

<p>He then very carefully divided the Stag into four equal parts.</p>

<p>"I am King Lion," he said, when he had finished, "so of course I
get the first part. This next part falls to me because I am the
strongest; and <i>this</i> is mine because I am the bravest."</p>

<p>He now began to glare at the others very savagely. "If any of you
have any claim to the part that is left," he growled, stretching
his claws <ins class="typo" title="Probably menacingly.">meaningly</ins>, "now is the time to speak up."</p>

<p>The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was
the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and
bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak.</p>

<p>"Let us agree," said the Sun, "that he is the stronger who can
strip that Traveler of his cloak."</p>

<p>"Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold,
howling blast against the Traveler.</p>

<p>With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about
the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around
him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him.
The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts
were in vain.</p>

<p>Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and
in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind,
the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from
his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer. The man
took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated
that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing
sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by
the roadside.</p>

<p>The Lion had been badly hurt by the horns of a Goat, which he was
eating. He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose
for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things
as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all
animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>The command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so
unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even
the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to
fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about
the fearful Lion.</p>

<p>And when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine,
and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a
terrible fright seized him.</p>

<p>"Goodby, neighbor Cricket," he called. "I'm off. He will
certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say."</p>

them all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed in

Sheep.</p>

<p>"Why is there always this hostility between us?" they said. "If
it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I
am sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and you
will see what good friends we shall become."</p>

lives.</p>

was not an excuse for stealing. A Cock, rising early, discovered
what had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so he
went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy.</p>

<p>The Fox saw a slender chance of escape.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," he said, "I was just on my way to visit a sick
relative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangled
up. But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causing
sorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string to
pieces."</p>

<p>An Ass found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter. He
dressed himself in it, and amused himself by hiding in a thicket
and rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way. All
took to their heels the moment they saw him.</p>

<p>The Ass was so pleased to see the animals running away from him,
just as if he were King Lion himself, that he could not keep from
expressing his delight by a loud, harsh bray. A Fox, who ran with
the rest, stopped short as soon as he heard the voice.
Approaching the Ass, he said with a laugh:</p>

too. But you gave yourself away with that silly bray."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
